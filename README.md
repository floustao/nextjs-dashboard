## Biggest takeaways:
- Refresher on how to optimize fonts & images
- The use of layout.tsx to optimize performance (only page.tsx will rerender)
- usePathname hook to show users on what page they currently are
- implement Streaming pattern using loading.tsx (at page level) and/or Suspense (at component level)
- use route grouping by naming (folder) with parentheses and be able to target these groups with spinners
- manage search state with URL search params instead of doing it client side to optimize shareability/bookmark feature, analytics/tracking and server side rendering
- use form actions to directly interact with DB and improve form validation and safety
